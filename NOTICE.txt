LICENSING NOTE: Contrary to -for example- C source code, which can
be processed by various compilers, a DexPatcher patch is explicitly
written to be used and interact with the DexPatcher tool. According
to the orthodox interpretation of GPL, such tightly-coupled cases
are considered derivative works, and as such DexPatcher patches can
only be distributed under the GPL or a GPL-compatible license. Also,
patches link and include the DexPatcher annotation package, which is
part of the tool and licensed under the GPL. (Please note that
rewriting the annotation package from scratch does not give you the
right to distribute DexPatcher patches under non-GPL compatible
licenses; in order to do that, you need to write a complete
DexPatcher replacement.)

tl;dr: All DexPatcher *patches* are covered by the GPL; you have to
make their source code available.
